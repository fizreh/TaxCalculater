# SalesTaxApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.1.

This project serves the basic purpose which is stated in the problem statement.I tried to solve problem 1 that is Tax Calculator. It prints the final reciept with Total and sales tax applied. How ever I tried to add the events but they are in process and not completed. I used angular material components to build the web app. I also tried to build the app and its published on https://fizreh.github.io/TaxCalculater/ but its not working right now because the server couldnt find the static files that are put in the docs or dist folder after making a build (ng build --prod). I also placed webserverurl in their respective files but right now its not working and i am looking into it.

My recent code is in the SecondBranch branch. You can clone it from my repo and run it with "npm start" or "ng serve".

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
